Oracle's Misfortune (五弊三缺, Wu-bi-san-que)

Wu-bi-san-que (lit. "The five misfortunes and three drawbacks") is a rumour that those who try to unveil the heaven's secrets (Oracles and fortune-tellers alike) will be punished by the gods. 

Those that are punished are said to lose their relatives and friends (Five misfortunes), while also lacking in wealth, health and influence (Three drawbacks).
