Wild Boar Sausage

There are many wild boars in the mountains of Taiwan, and boar cuisine is an indispensable part of Taiwanese aboriginal culture.

In the past, a roasted boar would have been enough to fulfil an entire tribe's dinnerâ€” However, in modern times roast boars are usually prepared and sold as small sausages, allowing city people to get a chance to enjoy this traditional delicacy.

Other dishes such as stone barbecues and bamboo rice are considered modern aboriginal cuisine and are very popular in Taiwan.
