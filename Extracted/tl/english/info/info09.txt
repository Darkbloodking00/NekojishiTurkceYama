Wutai (霧台)

Pronounced Vedai in the Rukai language, Wutai is located north-east of Pingtung, Taiwan.

It is said that when the Rukai first came to this place, they saw many clouded leopards living in the area. (The Rukai people honour clouded leopards greatly). For this reason, they settled there, forming the Wutai tribe.
