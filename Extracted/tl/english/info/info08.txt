Aidridringane

Meaning "The hidden one" in the Rukai language, Aidridringane is an invisible, omnipresent spirit. The word is used in different ways, sometimes it refers to a single spirit, sometimes spirits as a whole. Aidridringane usually lives someplace within the wild and is also thought to have human emotions.

The Rukai have many taboos, and if a taboo is violated, the soul of the violator will be taken by Aidridringane.

In Nekojishi, Aidridringane is said to be the lord of the sacred lands, king of the hundred pacers. However, it is just a version of this diverse folklore.
