Rukai

The Rukai are one of Taiwan's aboriginal peoples. 

They consist of six subgroups residing in southern Taiwan, each of which has its own dialect of the Rukai language. They honour clouded leopards and hundred-pacer snakes (A kind of viper), which they believe to be the spirits of their ancestors. 

In Nekojishi we refer to the Wutai tribe of the Rukai community.
