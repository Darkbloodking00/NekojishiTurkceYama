Jitong (乩童)

In Chinese folk religion, a Jitong, or Tongji (lit. "divining youth" or "youth diviner") is a person believed to have been chosen by the deities to serve as a medium between them and humans.

Jitong are usually chosen on their virtues as a representative to communicate with their people. People can also ask questions to the gods through the Jitong. However, a deity will only possess the body of a Jitong when they need to say something directly.

Therefore, consulting a Jitong during such times is considered as talking to a deity directly. Many temples have specific schedules when people can consult Jitong.
