City God (城隍, Chenghuang)

In Chinese vernacular, Chenghuang (lit. "the walls and the moat") usually refers to Chenghuangshen (lit. "god of the moat and the walls"), or simply the "City God".

The place of city god is usually taken by a famous local resident after their death. They are governors of the afterlife realm and like their living counterparts, they rule over and deal with affairs within their assigned city. For this reason, officials often worship their local city god in hope of having them coordinate work in both realms.

Traditionally, a City God only protects people living within a particular area. However, many immigrants still worship the City Gods of their hometowns even after moving to Taiwan. For example, the famous Xia-Hai City God in Taipei is actually the City God of Tong-an, Fujian. In this case, many "non-local City Gods" in Taiwan are no longer referred as Chenghuang although people still worship them as local deities.

The City God Temple of the Taiwan Prefecture was built in Tainan during the Ming Dynasty. 

Later, the Qing government upgraded the Hsinchu City God Temple to the prefectural City God Temple. 

After World War II, the City God Temple of Taiwan Province was built in Taipei. 

It is often debated which of these three City Gods rules Taiwan.
