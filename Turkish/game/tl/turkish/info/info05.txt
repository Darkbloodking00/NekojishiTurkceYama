Possessing ritual (起乩, Qiji)

Qiji (lit. divination) refers to the ritual of a Jitong being possessed by a spirit. Also known as Fuji (Spirit writing). Depending on the spirit, Jitong or local cultures, the ritual has many variations. 

For example, if possessed by Ji Gong (A minor deity in Chinese folk religion, usually depicted with a bottle of wine in their right hand), the Jitong will appear drunk. Afterwards the Jitong's memory of being possessed will differ as well.
